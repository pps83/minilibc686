# minilibc686: minimalistic libc for Linux i386 and i686, for static linking

minilibc686 is a minimalistic C library (libc) targeting Linux i386 and
i686, for building statically linked ELF-32 executables, written in NASM
assembly lanuage. Most of the code is manually optimized for size (rather
than speed) in assembly. Feature tradeoffs were made to achieve small sizes.

Features:

* It targets the i386 (first implemented by the Intel 80386 CPU introduced
  in 1985-10) or i686 (P6, first implemented by the Intel Pentium Pro CPU
  introduced in 1995-11), selectable at compile time (`-DCONFIG_I386`).
* It uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl
  calling convention (same as System V ABI), see details below.
* Some of the functions have a position-independent implementation,
  selectable at compile time (`-DCONFIG_PIC`). This is similar to
  `gcc -fpic`, but better. The precompiled code doesn't have any data
  dependencies (i.e. it's self-contained), and it can be copied to any
  address in memory and executed there. Thus it's modular on the binary level.
* Function implementations are also provided as NASM (0.98.39, released on
  2005-01-15) source code, and can be copy-pasted to other NASM projects.
  Thus it's modular on the source level.
* A C compiler is not necessary, see demo_hello_linux_nolibc.nasm and
  demo_hello_linux.nasm for building a Linux i386 32-bit ELF executable with
  NASM only.
* For this source code, NASM 0.98.39 generates bitwise identical output no
  matter the optimization level (`-O0` vs `-O999999999`).

Try it on Linux i386 or Linux amd64 (without the leading `$`):

```
$ ./minicc --tcc -s -W -Wall -o demo demo_c_hello.c
$ ./demo
Hello, World!
```

The first time you run it, it builds the mini686.a using the bundled NASM
(`tools/nasm-0.98.39`).

The *minicc* compiler fronted is a drop-in replacement for `gcc`, `clang` or
`tcc` for building ELF-32 executables for Linux i386, statically linked
against minilibc686. If you specify the `--tcc` flag, it will use the
bundled TinyCC compiler (`tools/pts-tcc`). Without that flag, it will use the
system GCC. To use the system Clang, specify `--gcc=clang`. Please note that
*minicc* is work in progress.

An end-to-end demo for building a printf-hello-world program in NASM
assembly with minilibc686, targeting Linux i386 32-bit ELF (actually i686
processors), is provided in test_demo_hello_linux.sh. For the build you need
a Linux host system and NASM. NASM also does the linking with `-f bin` and
the provided elf0.inc.nasm.

An end-to-end demo for building a printf-hello-world C program with
minilibc686, targeting Linux i386 32-bit ELF (actually i686 processors), is
provided in *test_demo_c_hello_linux.sh*. For the build you need a Linux i386
or amd64 host system. The build script uses the bundled NASM 0.98.39
assembler and the bundled TinyCC compiler, and it also autodetects GCC, and
if available, builds with GCC as well. Please note that using the *minicc*
compiler frontend is preferred (to the shell script
*test_demo_c_hello_linux.sh*) is recommended, see the command line above.

Please note that minilibc686 is currently not ready as a general libc
replacement for Linux, mostly because most of the functions haven't been
written yet, and there is no good linker provided yet. (The linkers of GCC,
Clang and TinyCC work, but they are not particularly impressive, because
they add some boilerplate which cannot be disabled.)

Design limitations:

* No 64-bit support, it's 32-bit Intel (IA-32) only.
* Implementation is incomplete: only a few dozen functions are implemented,
  it's much less than the full C89 standard library.
* For the floating-point functions, an FPU is assumed to be available even
  for i386. (Linux does provide an emulation for systems which don't have
  it. i686 (P6, Pentium Pro) introduced in 1995-11 has it.)
* No multithreading support: the libc assumes that the program runs in a
  single thread.
* No debugging support.
* No profiling support.
* No errno. The return value indicate failure as usual, but more specific
  error code is not available.
* No locale support: isalpha(3), tolower(3), strncasecmp(3) etc. are
  ASCII-only (equivalent of LC_ALL=C).
* No wide character support, only the 8-bit string functions are provided.
* printf(3) is very limited: no long or *long long* support, no
  floating-point support, only a few format specifiers are supported.
* No address randomization.
* No stack protection.
* No speed optimizations, code is optimized for size.
* Building as a shared library (*.so, *.dylib, *.dll) is not supported.
* Only the cdecl calling convention is supported.
* No autodetection of needed features, the user has to pick the individual
  function from the alternatives provided.
* No minimalist, tiny executable linking built in. To build an executable,
  the user has to use external C compilers, linkers and build
  configurations.

Calling convention:

* minilibc686 uses the
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#cdecl calling
  convention (same as System V ABI), see details below.
* cdecl in a nutshell: function arguments passed on the stack; the caller
  cleans up the arguments; 32-bit or shorter integer result is returned in
  EAX; 64-bit integer result is returned in EDX:EAX; pointer result is
  returned in EAX; only EAX, EDX and ECX aren't preserved by the calle.
* The cdecl calling convention (with some more specifics) is the default for
  GCC on Linux i386 and also the default for Clang, TinyCC and the Microsoft
  C compiler.
* For the OpenWatcom C compiler, specify `owcc -mabi=cdecl` or
  `wcc386 -ecc'.
* Since GCC 4.5 by default, stack must be aligned to 16-byte boundary at a
  function call. minilibc686 requires only the alignment to 4-byte boundary,
  which can be enabled with `gcc -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2` and `clang
  `-mstack-alignment=4`.
* Floating-point values are returned in ST(0), ST(1)..ST(7) must be free
  (popped or freed) on return.

Linker problems:

* GNU gold(1) 2.22 is mostly correct.

  * It adds empty PT_LOAD phdr (for .rodata).
  * It creates PT_GNU_STACK only if `-z execstack' or `-z noexecstack' was
    specified, or if any of the .o files contain a declaration -- but .o
    files generated by GNU as(1) compiled from .s generated by GCC do
    contain it.
  * It doesn't add unnecessary alignment.
  * With `-N`, it can merge all sections (rwx).
  * It supports linking weak ELF symbols properly.
  * Binary size is huge: 2 082 968 bytes.
  Linking command is:
  `ld -z execstack -nostdlib -m elf_i386 -static -o prog f1.o f2.o lib.a`
* pts-tcc 0.9.26 (`pts-tcc -nostdlib'):
  * (incorrect?!) It puts string contants (.rodata.str1.1) to .data (writable)
  * It aligns sections to 0x20 bytes.
  * It doesn't have -Wl,-e,_start to specify the entry point symbol.
  * It doesn't look for _start in the .a file.
  * It also cannot merge ASCIIZ string literals (?).
  * It starts .text at 0x80 (rather than 0x74).
  * It aligns .data to 0x20*x, and it also aligns end of .data to 0x20*x.
  * It doesn't align .rodata though.
  * It also aligns .bss (but not the end of .bss) to 0x20*x.
  * It adds 2 PT_LOADs, and no PT_GNU_STACK. (Can we patch it to add only
    1 PT_LOAD?)
  * It may be too slow for large projects.
  * It supports linking weak ELF symbols properly.

TODOs:

* !! Make sure that the binary output is bitwise identical with NASM 2.13.02.
* ELF patch: .o change a symbol from global to weak in an .o file
* ELF patch: implement sstrip
* ELF patch: change the EI_OSABI to Linux
* ELF patch: .o remove section .note.GNU-stack
* ELF patch: .o change section alignments
* ELF patch: change the last 12 bits of the 1st PT_LOAD to 0 (pts-tcc needs
  it, maybe for compression with UPX)
