This directory contains the very few shell commands needed by the
 `minicc  cc` command, i.e. when *minicc* is acting as a compiler frontend.
The shell commands are implemented by *busybox* in this directory, other
commands are just symlinks. The toolchain commands (such as *nasm-0.98.39*)
are in the `tools` directory.
